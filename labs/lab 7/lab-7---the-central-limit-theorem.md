### Our data

The `dslabs` package contains a dataset called `murders` which contains
data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about firearm
murders in the 50 US states and Washington, D.C for the year 2010. A
preview of the data is shown below.

    ##        state abb region population total
    ## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135
    ## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19
    ## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232
    ## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93
    ## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257
    ## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65

### Your tasks

1.  Download and install the `dslabs` package and then load the
    `murders` dataset. Create a new variable, `murders_per_100k`, which
    gives the number of murders per 100,000 people in each state. If you
    have done this correctly, the first 6 rows of `murders` should now
    look identical to the output below. If you donâ€™t already know how to
    calculate this value, a quick Google search will show you how.

    ##        state abb region population total murders_per_100k
    ## 1    Alabama  AL  South    4779736   135         2.824424
    ## 2     Alaska  AK   West     710231    19         2.675186
    ## 3    Arizona  AZ   West    6392017   232         3.629527
    ## 4   Arkansas  AR  South    2915918    93         3.189390
    ## 5 California  CA   West   37253956  1257         3.374138
    ## 6   Colorado  CO   West    5029196    65         1.292453

2.  The national firearm murder rate is the mean of `murders_per_100k`
    and it is reasonable to assert that this type of variable follows a
    Poisson distribution. Calculate the national murder rate, save this
    as a variable called `lambda` and print `lambda` as your answer to
    this question.

3.  Write a function called `murder_sim()` which produces a dataframe
    with `n` rows that consists of simulated national firearm murder
    rates that follow the appropriate distribution.

<!-- end list -->

  - Hint: This function is similar to `jury_sim()` from the tutorial

<!-- end list -->

4.  Using a `seed` integer of 10, use `murder_sim()` to create 10,000
    simulated national firearm murder rates. Save the resulting data as
    an object and then use it to create a histogram just like the one
    below. **But make sure you put the correct value for `lambda` in the
    subtitle.**

5.  Suppose that the year is now 2011 and you read in the newspaper that
    the FBI predicts that for this year, the firearm murder rate will be
    2.2% higher than in 2010. Using this predicted value for the 2011
    firearm murder rate as a test statistic together with your simulated
    data, calculate the proportion of simulated murder rates in your
    data that are greater than or equal to this value and explain
    whether or not this predicted murder rate is abnormally high
    compared to 2010. Illustrate this by modifying the histogram you
    made to answer the last question.
